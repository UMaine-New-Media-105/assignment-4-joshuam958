Question 1: I decided to make a abstract looking flower only using stroke and no fill. I learned a lot about using loops while doing this assignment. My initial errors were minor typos.

Question 2: I honestly mostly followed the video for this one, I didn't expect it to be as complicated as it was. But the results turned out fine.

Question 3: This was very simple for me. I just added randomness to almost all of the objects, to randomize position, size, and number of petals of the 3 flowers. I also added some randomness to how many tiles there will be.
